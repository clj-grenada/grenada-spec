Grenada is a Clojure metadata build and distribution system.

This repo houses the Grenada specification (start with reading the
[overview](SpecOverview.md)) and other things, which I couldn't find a better
place for.

## Git Workflow

Except for a few commits in the beginning, branching and merging follows
[Driessen's model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
Versions and releases are those of the specification.

## See also

The repositories grouped under https://github.com/clj-grenada are all in some
way related to Grenada development.

## Thanks

…to Reid McKenzie (@arrdem) and Alex Miller (@puredanger) for mentoring me in
this project.
