# Grenada

Clojure metadata build and distribution system.

## Version

0.1.4

## Notes

 - Don't think too much about the distribution of information across the
   different files. I will probably do a bunch of rearrangements some time.
 - Right now `GrenadaFormat.md` underspecifies things, whereas `GrenadaDraft.md`
   specifies a lot, but is outdated and may not be what we want.

## Changelog

Contains only changes that can't be assigned to a single document.

### 0.1.4

 - Add README as an overview and in order to provide uniform versioning for all
   the documents.
 - Add documents about different storage formats and about the conceptual
   components for creating Grenada builds.
