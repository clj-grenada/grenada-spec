# How to contribute?

 - If you wish to contribute, but don't know what, have a look at the
   [roadmap](roadmap.md) or send me a message.

 - If you know what you want to do, you probably also know your way around the
   GitHub issue tracker and pull requests. Those are your tools for
   contributing. Before you invest a lot of time in code that might not fit with
   my ideas, it's also a good idea to write me an email or open an issue.

 - Whatever you contribute, please read the [README of
   lib-grenada](https://github.com/clj-grenada/lib-grenada/) first.
