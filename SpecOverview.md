# Grenada Specification

This is a rough and work-in-progress specification of how Grenada is supposed to
work. It consists of this overview and the files
[GrenadaDraft.md](GrenadaDraft.md), [GrenadaParts.md](GrenadaParts.md) and
[GrenadaFormats.md](GrenadaFormats.md). Formally,
[GrenadaScenarios.md](GrenadaScenarios.md) also belongs to it, but it is more a
historical heap of notes than anything else.


## Version

0.1.5

## Notes

 - ❁ Important notes are marked with ❁. The other notes might still be
   interesting, but are more notes to myself. However, if you have a question
   about something, please read the notes on it first. – They might already
   contain the answer.
 - The distribution of information across files has gotten better, but is still
   not good.

## Changelog

Contains only changes that can't be assigned to a single document. All
changelogs only list changes I consider important and interesting. Typos,
rewordings and additions of some notes are usually not included.

### 0.1.5

 - Introduce the marker ❁.
 - Rearrange some things between files.

### 0.1.4

 - Add README as an overview and in order to provide uniform versioning for all
   the documents.
 - Add documents about different storage formats and about the conceptual
   components for creating Grenada builds.
